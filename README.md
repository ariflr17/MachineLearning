# MachineLearning Tasks

Task 2:Explore Supervised Machine Learning
The second task involves predicting the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

Task 3: Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning
The third task involes predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. This is based on K_means_clustering algorithm.

Task 4: Decision Tree Algorithm
The fourth task involes creating  Decision Tree classifier visualize it graphically. The purpose is to predict the right class accordingly to classfication.
